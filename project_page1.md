## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a comprehensive Excel dashboard for analysing sales performance, based on a client engagement. The dashboard, recreated here with mock data, originated from a need to provide in-depth insights into sales operations over the 2016 to 2018 period. A key part of the project involved using SQL for data extraction and preparation, showcasing my ability to integrate data analysis tools for insightful visualisations.

3. What are the detailed revenues per region, store, product category, and brand?
4. Who are the top customers and sales representatives?

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For data extraction and preparation from the company's relational database, highlighting the importance of data accuracy and relevance.
