## [Synthesising Privacy: Generating Time-Series Data for Mental Health Monitoring with TimeGAN](/project_page2)

### Description

This project applied Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN) to the CrossCheck dataset for generating synthetic time-series data, aiming to monitor severe mental illness symptoms while addressing privacy concerns. It demonstrates that synthetic data can closely mimic real datasets in statistical properties and temporal dynamics.

### Tools

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing with Python.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and data preprocessing.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the TimeGAN model.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualisation.
- **Python Standard Libraries**:
  - `Path` from pathlib: For filesystem path operations.
  - `tqdm`: For progress bars during data processing and model training.

## [Mapping Health: Interactive Analysis of Flu Vaccination Trends](/project_page3)

### Description

This project recreates a public health dashboard to analyse and visualise flu shot distribution in 2022 by age, race, and county. It leverages SQL for data handling and Tableau for dynamic visualisations, employing PostgreSQL and pgAdmin for data management. The project highlights the effective use of technical skills to transform complex datasets into actionable public health insights.

### Tools

- **SQL**: For database querying and manipulation.
- **Tableau**: For creating dynamic and interactive visualisations.
- **PostgreSQL & pgAdmin**: For database management and administration.
- **Spreadsheet Software**: For initial data analysis and manipulation.
- **ODBC**: For database connectivity and integration with Tableau.
