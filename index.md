### [Synthesising Privacy: Generating Time-Series Data for Mental Health Monitoring with TimeGAN](/project_page2)

#### Description

This project applied Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN) to the CrossCheck dataset for generating synthetic time-series data, aiming to monitor severe mental illness symptoms while addressing privacy concerns. It demonstrates that synthetic data can closely mimic real datasets in statistical properties and temporal dynamics.

#### Tools Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing with Python.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and data preprocessing.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the TimeGAN model.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Python Standard Libraries**:
  - `Path` from pathlib: For filesystem path operations.
  - `tqdm`: For progress bars during data processing and model training.
